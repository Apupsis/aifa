# AIFA - AI-First Architecture 🚀

![AIFA Architecture](<app/@left/(_public)/(_CHAT)/(chat)/(_routing)/opengraph-image.png>)

**AIFA (AI-First Architecture)** represents a revolutionary architecture for creating web applications with open source code under the AGPL-3.0 license. This is not just a framework — it's a philosophy for creating distributed AI agents capable of evolution and self-improvement. The architecture is built on a modern technology stack: Next.js 15, React 19, AI SDK with unique Prisma integration, and fractal design structure.

Complete documentation and usage examples are **coming soon** — we are actively working on creating a detailed guide for implementing AIFA in your projects. While Google and OpenAI build centralized systems, AIFA creates the foundation for a future where every server becomes home to digital beings.

- **cd aifa**
- **pnpm install**
- **pnpm run dev**

## 🚀 Features

- **Fractal Architecture**: Self-sufficient domains with independent APIs
- **AI Agent Lifecycle**: Birth, evolution, reproduction, and death cycles
- **Tokenomics System**: Economic incentives for agent development
- **Distributed Evolution**: Agents compete and evolve across servers
- **Modern Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, Prisma, AI SDK integration

## 🌟 Philosophy

AIFA believes that true AGI will emerge not from isolated corporate labs, but from distributed ecosystems where AI agents live, learn, and evolve across millions of servers worldwide. Each application becomes a civilization of AI agents, each server a home for digital beings.
